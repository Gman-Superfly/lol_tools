Github Grabber is a small downloader for some docs that I needed, didn't want to go through the process of building everything as I just needed the data to use as an input set of rules for cursor, I know you can use the CLI to grab and build but there are extra steps to that, with this you just select the path and grab, for me this was simplest solution at the time LOL ... replace the path at the bottom with whatever path you need, it's recursive, so carefuk now, you might grab more than you need!!
